Application Deployment:

1.When MySQL database is deployed you need to change "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/lurie_db?serverTimezone=UTC"
localhost address with ipaddress from server where you have deployed your database.

2.Then you deployed also the backend "spring boot" application

3.Then you deploy the frontend "react" application, and when you have the frontend deployed ipaddress,
you need to change in both controllers in backend the annotation "@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:3000")" 
the ipaddress or domain of your deployed frontend application.

-Admin url for adding new keys files is: (http://localhost:3000/keys/admin/lurie/edit)
